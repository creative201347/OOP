We can create an object of one class into another and that object will be a member of the class.
This type of relationship between classes is known as containership or has_a relationship
And the class which contains the object and members
    of another class is called a container class.
The object that is part of another object is called contained object,
    whereas object that contains another object as it part or attribute is called container object.

// Class that is to be contained
class first

// Container class
class second
