/*
A class that contains a pure virtual function is known as an abstract class.
We cannot create objects of an abstract class.
However, we can derive classes from them, and use their data members and member functions (except pure virtual functions).

class Shape {
    public:

      // creating a pure virtual function
      virtual void calculateArea() = 0;
};
